## Projects

### 1) Adaptive vehicle speed controller
  **Objective**		: The system detects restricted zones via RF signals and automatically adjusts vehicle speed using a microcontroller. It                                              provides manual control in non-restricted areas through push buttons and offers real-time driver feedback via an LCD and audio alerts.
  <br>**Technology Used**	: Arduino Nano, RF modules, I2C, SPI, KiCad 9.0
  <br>**Link** 	: [github.com/bestinalias/Adaptive-vehicle-speed-controller](https://github.com/bestinalias/Adaptive-vehicle-speed-controller) 

### 2) STRIDE Makeathon
  **Objective**		: Developed a prototype of a simple, low-cost communication tool for non-verbal children with moderate physical & comprehension challenges. The device is portable and uses RF ID tags that are scanned to output audio through a speaker to convey the user's needs.
  <br>**Technology Used**	: Arduino Nano, UART, SPI, KiCad 9.0
