## Projects

### Adaptive vehicle speed controller
  <br>**Objective**		: The system detects restricted zones via RF signals and automatically adjusts vehicle speed using a microcontroller. It                                              provides manual control in non-restricted areas through push buttons and offers real-time driver feedback via an LCD and audio alerts.
  <br>**Technology Used**	: Arduino Nano, RF modules, I2C, SPI, KiCad 9.0
  <br>**Link** 	: [github.com/bestinalias/Adaptive-vehicle-speed-controller](https://github.com/bestinalias/Adaptive-vehicle-speed-controller)
